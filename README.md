You are a valued employee of MegaCorp Inc.

Locked in your basement office you've been gathering information about your coworkers Adalbert, Beatrice and Celis. They're working in shifts on a single machine and you've been monitoring and logging their daily routines. Unfortunately they found out, disabled their webcams, removed your Trojan and cut off your access to switches and routers. Even though you are blind now, it's still mandatory for you to know who is currently working for any, because only Adalbert isn't vigilant enough to notice when you sneak up to the ground floor to snatch some donuts and cake from their office fridge.

Except... you still got the old logs and you can see the LEDs of their switch blinking. Unfortunately you don't have physical access, but perhaps you can still try to figure out, who's shift it is?
